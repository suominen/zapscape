# Zapscape — Linux KVM/x86 guest-to-host escape tracking site

Source for the **Zapscape** patch-status tracker: a single-page site
recording which distributions have shipped a fix for the KVM/x86
guest-to-host escape in the Linux kernel.

## Where the facts live

Everything about the bug — CVE IDs, affected and fixed versions, upstream
fix commits, discovery and disclosure credit, and current per-distribution
patch status — belongs to the tracker page, not to this README:

- **Rendered:** <https://kimmo.cloud/zapscape/>
- **Source:** [`site/content/_index.md`](site/content/_index.md)

Edit that file; everything else in this repo is build infrastructure.

None of it is restated here on purpose.  The tracker page is revised as
CVEs are assigned and distributions ship fixes — for the actively updated
trackers, twice daily by the auto-update agent — so any copy kept in this
README would silently rot.  Resist re-adding a summary.

Deployment plan and current setup state live in
[`WEBSITE.md`](WEBSITE.md).

## Local development

Requires Hugo extended (≥ 0.146.0) and Go (for Hugo Modules to fetch the
PaperMod theme).

### With Nix (recommended)

```sh
nix develop          # dev shell: hugo, go, git, resvg
cd site
hugo server          # local preview at http://localhost:1313/zapscape/
```

If you use [direnv](https://direnv.net/), `direnv allow` once and the dev
shell auto-activates whenever you `cd` into the repo.

### Without Nix

Install Hugo extended ≥ 0.146.0 and Go ≥ 1.24 yourself, then:

```sh
cd site
hugo server          # http://localhost:1313/zapscape/
```

## Build and publish

```sh
make build       # local build into site/public/
make dist        # build, then rsync to haig:/zapscape/
make banner      # re-rasterise the social banner SVG → PNG (needs resvg + Roboto)
```

`make dist` runs `make build` first.  `make banner` is only needed after
editing `site/assets/zapscape-tracker.svg`; the rendered PNG is committed.
